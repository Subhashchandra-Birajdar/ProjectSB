API - Application programming interface
-->
API is a protocol and rules
API through two application can communicate
API is intermediater between two application/software

example :
Restaurant (application)
Kitchen (another system/service)
Menu ( API Specifications)
Waiter (API)

Types of API Requests
---- > Get,post,put,delete

Need of API
--> reduce manual efforts and automate everything, so developer focus on business logic

Get
--->
Retrieve or GET resource from server
Used only to read data(200, or 404)

Post Request
--> Create resource from server( user login/registration) -- response code(201,400)

PUT Request
--> Update existing resource on Server, only use for update not for get/create

DELETE Request
--> used to DELETE resource from Server( delete the account), not used for get/update/create, response(200,400,404)

Status code
 --> like acknowledgement from server(success or failure)
classification of status code( 5 category)
1xx -> information
2xx -> successful
3xx -> redirection
4xx -> client Error
5xx -> server Error

Commonly used status code
--> 
200 --> OK
201 --> Created
204 --> No content(nothing to return)
301 --> moved permanently
400 --> bad request
401 --> Unauthorized(don't have access)
403 --> forbidden(server refuse to return(because of access)
404 --> not found
500 --> internal server Error

Why do you need web framework ?
-->
website have a lot in common
security, database, URLs, Authentication..more
Should you do this everytime from scratch ?

Think of building a House
-->
you would need Blueprint and Tools
That's how web developement works
Developers had to build from scratch

what if..
you should have prefabricate components?
could you assemble faster?
could you reduce error? (rather than doing repetative things

what is web framework
---> (collection of tools and modules )
web framework is nothing but collection of tools and modules that is needed to do standard tasks across every web application.

Java based Web Framwork --> Spring Boot(Java)
Every website work on client server architecture, so client is the device or application

characteristics of client
----->
contains UI(user interface)
send request services and receive response as data.

server
--->
server is device or application that provide service or resource to client.
server designed to handle multiple request from the client and return the response data.
server hosts the website.

characteristics of server
--->
always on(connected to internet)
handle multiple requests
send data to client based on request
Example : suppose ecommerce website(client), if he send any request goes to server, it process the request based on the send data to the client.

why are api's needed?
-->
share data
speed up development(save the time and productivity)
Extend the reach & functionality of software

popular API's
---->
Google maps API(uber use this for rauting infomation)
twitter API
Facebook's Graph API
Amazon S3 API

Types of API
-->
1. Internal API(one team to other team), this api can't expose outside the world(like notificatio)
2. External API's(use by anyone facebook, google)
3. Partner API's

Spring is java based framwork

Features of Spring framwork
------->
IOC(inversion of Control, manage lifecycle of bean)
DI(Dependency injection)
loose coupling
Data access( accessing data from different sources(jdbc,jpa,hibernate))
MVC framework(Separation in code(model(entity)-view(html&JSP)-controller)
Transaction Management(on object)
Security
Testing support(Junit and integration)
Internalization(i18n) and Locallization

Use cases of spring 
---> basically use for web development
enterprise app, microservices architecture, web application

Coupling
--->
Coupling means how closely connected components or systems
1. tight coupling --> hard to maintain,scalable,modularity, if any component not working
2. loose coupling --> by default spring provide this, less dependent and no impact on the other

spring core
--->
Loose coupling, IOC, DI, beans
Spring container(manages the object, provide objects runtime) & configuration.
Bean factory(old simplest one, provide basic features) & applicationContext(new & advance has more features.
As a developer, we can tell to spring, manage this beans and provide classpath in XML or annotation base configuration
Basically configuring contain bean defination, we have to define/declare the beans in XML base configuration
Annotations is an meta data that we can use with code.

Spring review
-->
Explicit bean configuration
no embeded server
component scanning
boilerplate code

SpringBoot ?
-->
Open source, java based framework, used to create stand alone production-grade spring based applications

Spring vs springboot
Spring ==> Lots of steps invoved in setting up, configuration, writing boilerplate code,deployment of the app
springboot ==> set of pre-configuratin/defaults, eliminating the need of boilerplate code that was involved in spring application.

Components of springboot
---->
Springboot starter(kind of library, bundeled inside)
auto configuration
spring actuator
embeded server
springboot devtools

Advantages of springboot
-->
stand alone and quick start
starter code
less configuration
reduced cost and application developement time

why do developer love spring boot
-->
java based
fast, easy
comes with embeded server
avoid boilerplate code and auto-configuration

Spring boot architecture
-->
Presentation layer -- front end view(controller class exist, accept the request validate the input, send to service)
service layer --> business related logics, evaluations, decision making processing of data at this layer.
data access layer --> where all the repository classes, reponsible for intracting with database, &  perform operation.

Browser ==> Controller(Request&Response) <-> Service <-> Repository <==> Database 

Spring Initializr
Group --> opposite to the application URL
Artifact --> project name
Dependencies are managed through Maven/Gradle.

@RestController --> Handle http request
dispatcherServlet --> Entry point, every request goes through this way

Rest API - Representation state transfer application programming interface
-->
REST API is popular architectural style to designing network application
Web services are build following the rest achitectural style knows as restful web services.

Benefits of REST API
-->
Simplicity, Scalabilty, flexibility, visibility

1.HTTPS and HTTP, basically use to tranfering hypertext to the view
2. Both can transfer data in various format including html,json and plain text


Jackson --> java object to json and json to java object , in springboot internally happen
@Pathvariable --> we use in springboot to pass value dynamically through URL. it will match to the URL in controller, so dynamic URL handle by pathvariable.

Advantages of JPA
---->
Easy and Simple, Makes quering easier
Allows to save & update object (Perform DML operation)
Easy integration with springboot, springboot inbuilt supports

Data Access Layer
--->
Responsible for performing CRUD operation
Example : Create job, read job, update job, delete job

JPA for standard implementation is Hibernate
--> get predefined methods

H2 database
-->
open source relational database
written in java, fast in-memory database
not used in production-grade application
